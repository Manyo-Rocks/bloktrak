## Description
Land deed registry famously difficult to track in Africa, it's why the courts are filled with property litigation. Multiple registration, fraudulent sales, and suboptimal systems for transfer of land deeds mean the ownership of too many parcels of land is often left to the whims and caprices of a jury of peers.

Enter bloktrak.

Bloktrak is  decentralized blockchain platform to securely register, verify, track and transfer land deeds. Its purpose is to simplify the manual process of property registration in Africa by issuing non-fungible tokens to land owners with each land's survey plan data uniquely stored in the metadata of the nft and stored on the polygon blokchain network.

Tracking land deeds on the blockchain.


## Contributors
Bloktrak is developed by a team of Ignatius Musonda, Judith Manyo Ogar, Jojo Mensah, Stephen Oluwasanmi and Joseph Nwosu for the Polygon Africa Bootcamp 2022 Hackathon.


## Features
- Register land and mint corresponding, unique custom ERC721 tokens as proof of ownership
- Query blockchain for land deed ownership and survey plan (meta)data.
- Transfer land deeds easily
- Manage land deeds owned by your account
- Put up land deed for sale and manage bids


## Disclaimer
Bloktrak is currently deployed on the Mumbai Polygon testnet, as we're still testing out, breaking and mending a few things. The testnet works just like the mainnet but you'd be using testnet matic to verify your transactions.

Registering a land deed is currently free but would cost you a bit of gas. It's how the blockchain works if you're new to the blockchain. Here is a link
//insert mumbai faucet link
to get some test mumbai matic to register your property. It's completely free! If you still have a problem, please contact us
//insert twitter dm link
to send you some free testnet matic for the registration or to just chat about the project!

We also recommend that you use your desktop browser to use Bloktrak.
